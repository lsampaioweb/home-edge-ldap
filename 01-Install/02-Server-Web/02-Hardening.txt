01 - Hide Apache Version and Operating System
  sudo nano /etc/apache2/conf-enabled/security.conf
    ServerTokens Prod
    ServerSignature Off 

  sudo systemctl reload apache2

02 - Disable TRACE HTTP Request
  sudo nano /etc/apache2/conf-enabled/security.conf
    TraceEnable off

  sudo systemctl reload apache2

03 - Reduce the timeout
  sudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
    Timeout 60

  sudo systemctl reload apache2

04 - Disable Directory Listing and FollowSymLinks
  sudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

  Add “-” before each tag directive in the line:
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
  To become:
    Options -Indexes -FollowSymLinks

  sudo systemctl reload apache2

05 - Disable .htaccess files
  sudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
    AllowOverride None

  sudo systemctl reload apache2

06 - Preventing DoS attacks
  sudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
    RequestReadTimeout header=10-20,MinRate=500 body=20,MinRate=500

  sudo systemctl reload apache2

07 - Secure Apache using mod_security and mod_evasive Modules
  Mod_security
  Acts as a firewall for web servers and applications, providing protection against brute force attacks.

  sudo apt install libapache2-mod-security2 -y
  sudo systemctl restart apache2

  Mod_evasive
  Detects and provides protection against DDOS and HTTP brute force attacks. It detects attacks whenever: so many requests are directed to a page several times per second; temporarily blacklisted IP still tries to make a new request; child process attempts making more than 50 concurrent requests.

  sudo apt install libapache2-mod-evasive -y
  sudo systemctl restart apache2

08 - Limit Request Size
  By default, the HTTP request in Apache is unlimited hence web server is susceptible to DoS attacks by keeping it open for a high number of request. 
  <Directory "/var/www/">
    LimitRequestBody 10485760
  </Directory>
